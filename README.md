# The travelling salesman problem (TSP)

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route between a set of points and locations that must be visited. In the problem statement, the points are the cities a salesperson might visit. The salesmanâ€˜s goal is to keep both the travel costs and the distance traveled as low as possible.

In our case, we consider a given a set of shops and distance between every pair of shops, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every shop exactly once and returns to the starting point.

# About the tools...

For this program we used JavaScript with the library called p5.js.
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

To use it and run it online: https://editor.p5js.org/

To run it with Visual Studio Code there are the extensions: ps5.vscode and Live Server that can come handy.
